Credit Risk Modelling: Probability of Default Model
This project focuses on the development and implementation of a Probability of Default (PD) model for credit risk assessment, using Logistic Regression. The model aims to predict the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan based on various financial and demographic factors.

Key Aspects:
Data Preprocessing: In-depth analysis of the dataset, including cleaning and transformation of raw data to make it suitable for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Identification and creation of relevant features to enhance model performance.

Model Development: Building a Logistic Regression model to predict the probability of default.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curve.

Project Objectives:
Understand the financial and statistical concepts behind credit risk modelling.

Gain hands-on experience with real-world data to build a predictive model.

Use logistic regression techniques to solve a credit risk problem.

Analyze and interpret model results for actionable insights.

Tools and Libraries:
Python: Main programming language used for data analysis and modeling.

pandas & numpy: Data manipulation and numerical analysis.

scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating the logistic regression model.

matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization and exploration.
